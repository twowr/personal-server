|  go to path /storage to see available content
|             ^^^^^^^^
|____> IPADDRESS:61102/storage

every endpoint you request after /storage
will request an entry from the server filesystem
e.g.
                          |‾‾‾> the public folder
IPADDRESS:61102/storage/public
                   |___> the storage folder

the above address will display the content of the public folder
if a request is not a folder

IPADDRESS:61102/storage/public/publicText.txt
                                     |___> file name can contain spaces

the file content will be displayed if possible

NOTE: only request to the /storage path will be treated this way
      more storage path might be added in the future but most
      base path will be reserved for features, not storage


|  go to path /image to see all available images
|             ^^^^^^^^
|____> IPADDRESS:61102/image

every endpoint you request after /image
will start a recursive search for all images
starting at the requested directory
e.g.
                          |‾‾‾> the storage base path
IPADDRESS:61102/image/storage/loli---> the loli folder inside storage
                   |___> the image base path

in the event that the requested endpoint is a file path
it wouldn't show anything and wont throw an error(cuz my lazy ass)

NOTE: if you request to /image without the path
      it will perform the default behaviour of
      starting a recursive search at /storage
      in order words
      IPADDRESS:61102/image and IPADDRESS:61102/image/storage
      is the same thing


|  go to path /image to see all available audios
|             ^^^^^^^^
|____> IPADDRESS:61102/audio

every endpoint you request after /audio
will start a recursive search for all audios
starting at the requested directory
e.g.
                                                        |‾‾‾> the storage base path
IPADDRESS:61102/audio/storage/music> the music folder
                                          |___> the audio base path

in the event that the requested endpoint is a file path
it wouldn't show anything and wont throw an error(cuz my lazy ass)

NOTE: if you request to /audio without the path
      it will perform the default behaviour of
      starting a recursive search at /storage
      in order words
      IPADDRESS:61102/audio and IPADDRESS:61102/audio/storage
      is the same thing
