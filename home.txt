|  go to path /authenticate to gain access to viewing files
|             ^^^^^^^^
|____> IPADDRESS:42069/authenticate

|  go to path /storage to see available content
|             ^^^^^^^^
|____> IPADDRESS:42069/storage

every endpoint you request after /storage
will request an entry from the server filesystem
e.g.
                          |‾‾‾> the public folder
IPADDRESS:42069/storage/public
                   |___> the storage folder

the above address will display the content of the public folder

if a request is not a folder

IPADDRESS:42069/storage/public/publicText.txt
                                     |___> file name can contain spaces

the file content will be displayed if possible

NOTE: only request to the /storage path will be treated this way
      more storage path might be added in the future but most
      base path will be reserved for features, not storage


|  go to path /image to see all available images
|             ^^^^^^^^
|____> IPADDRESS:42069/image

every endpoint you request after /image
will start a recursive search for all images
starting at the requested directory
e.g.
                          |‾‾‾> the storage base path
IPADDRESS:42069/image/storage/loli---> the loli folder inside storage
                   |___> the image base path

in the event that the requested endpoint is a file path
it wouldn't show anything and wont throw an error(cuz my lazy ass)

NOTE: if you request to /image without the path
      it will perform the default behaviour of
      starting a recursive search at /storage
      in other words
      IPADDRESS:42069/image and IPADDRESS:42069/image/storage
      is the same thing


|  go to path /audio to see all available audios
|             ^^^^^^^^
|____> IPADDRESS:42069/audio

essentially the same as /image

NOTE: you can tap/click on the numeber to play the corresponding audio
